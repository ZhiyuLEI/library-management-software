# library-management-software
The built Library Management Software is to manage the day to day activities of a library. It has three types of users, the Admin, the Receptionist and the Customer. I had designed the GUIs of the whole software. And the following functions are basically achieved by my coding. Customers are registered to the system via the registration process managing by the receptionist, they can search and borrow the books. The Admin can purchase, manage books, and manage the reports as well as the usersâ€™ authorities and the receptionist login. The receptionist is responsible for customer registration. Following the MVC design pattern more strictly could be made in the improvements of this software.
